# About This Repository

This repository is currently archived. It was created by [@Yee](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=yeeagency) at the end of 2023.
If you want to know the story behind this repository, let me share it with you.

At the end of 2022, ChatGPT arrived, and I started using AI. In early 2023, I was working on an SEO tool + WordPress navigation template and was wondering what content to create. I thought, since I was learning about AI anyway, there might be an opportunity. So I used the Feynman learning method to organize some basic materials into a website.
The strategy was simple: since learning is a funnel, I focused on what the masses needed most.
ChatGPT / Midjourney / StableDiffusion - from how to register, use, and install them, to how to use prompts, and then to more advanced topics.
We organized a lot of content and one-click installation packages to help lower the barrier to entry.

The website was first posted on Jike, and later somehow A-jie on Twitter also shared it, then it started spreading on Douyin.
The viral mechanism was simple: because the content was valuable to users, bloggers on Douyin spontaneously made videos showcasing the website without telling users what it was. Users would ask in the comments, the videos got traffic, bloggers would reply, and the website also got traffic - forming a win-win-win situation. In two weeks, DAU reached 20,000.

At that time, we could build an AI private community of 10,000 people in a week. Monetization was simple: selling accounts, distributing ChatGPT wrapper affiliate programs. Later we set up a distribution mall, listing redemption codes for various AI products at the time, letting community members resell them.

We didn't run a community initially, feeling it was too much like cutting leeks. Later in April and May, there were a lot of copycat sites and content ecosystems, and leek-cutting communities multiplied.

Due to limited energy, I didn't focus more on running this, and gave the website to a friend. By the end of the year, DAU was only 2-3K.

At year-end, my friend asked me to see if there was still opportunity. So I made another push, verticalizing the content - organizing side hustle content from the market separately and aggregating it using a Github Repo. This wave was shared by Baoyu on X, the repository went viral, and the website DAU returned to 10K.

But it was still an operations issue. Poor operations led to continuous traffic decline. The most important thing for content ecosystems is operations - whether PGC or UGC, without good content there's no vitality. If you can't build a mechanism for continuous content production, you'll fall into a vicious cycle.

Later the website stopped operating. Today a user shared this repository on Twitter, and I saw many comments saying it redirected to adult websites, so I came to clean up this repository.

I often admire those in the black hat industry - they have many innovations both in automation thinking and traffic generation. For example, they acquired this repository's domain and used it for traffic hijacking. I estimate they probably have scripts monitoring various repos to buy unresolvable domains for this purpose.

Well, that's the end of the story. Now I'm building AI marketing tools around Twitter and Reddit ecosystems.
Recently I'm building [xaicreator.com](https://xaicreator.com), currently in early stages, a copycat of typefully, mainly helping people write tweets with AI and schedule posts to multiple social media platforms. Later it will evolve into an automated agent.
I'm also doing Reddit marketing. If you're working on Reddit, you can join this karma exchange community: [r/karmaswapper](https://www.reddit.com/r/karmaswapper/). To learn about Reddit, you can read this [Reddit Marketing Growth Handbook](https://xiaobot.com/p/reddit?refer=55449e05-d809-45e7-bf20-7750aa7fc1c6).

# Together with AI
We are currently trying and exploring AI side business techniques introduced by various bloggers on the internet, hoping to provide more valuable selections for everyone. The content will also be updated on the website, so please stay tuned.

# How to Start a Side Business Safely

## Four Suggestions
- `Focus on content creation to generate traffic, not just selling a product` - Traffic naturally requires products. Collaborating with others to facilitate transactions can be profitable.
- `Sell shovels, not dig for gold` - Digging for gold demands comprehensive project requirements and entails high risk. Selling shovels is often more direct.
    - `Private labeling` - If you create a product A, remember to sell product A to others, and you can even support private labeling to let everyone dig for gold together.
    - `Distribution` - If you are digging for gold yourself, it's best to find a way to let others do the same. Distribution is a good approach.
- `If you don't want to spend money, you have to spend time` - Buying knowledge and then executing it is less risky but requires costs. If you don't want to incur costs, you need to invest time. Continuously trial and error over time to find profitable ventures. Of course, spending money does not always guarantee the acquisition of knowledge, and you might end up being scammed.
- `Build assets, not sell time` - If your time cannot be sold multiple times, it's no different from regular employment. Focus on accumulating your assets instead of engaging in one-time sales of your time.

## One Strategy
Creating content for social media and relying on platforms is currently the most accessible path to using AI for side businesses.

# Sharing AI Technology Money-Making Ideas

## Understanding Money-Making in Technology
- `Focus on niche markets, not platforms` - If you want to create a product, make it highly specialized. With many generic GPT-based products, it's hard to stand out. But adding a niche, like a desktop version of GPT, social media GPT, or AI girlfriend chatbot GPT, can make you more recognizable.
- Favor what aligns with human nature, not against it: For example, writing novels aligns with human nature, while education might go against it.
- `Start small` - Don't aim too big from the start. Begin with something minimal, like creating an API for Midjourney if you're interested in building a Midjourney art site. Starting with a tool (the "shovel") can be profitable enough at first.
- Open source to gain traffic, which is more effective than digging for gold in closed source: Starting with open-source can continuously bring you resources, far more than remaining unknown in closed-source.
- `Build in Public` - This, combined with the above, can bring significant public recognition. With a foundation of traffic, you shouldn't worry about launching a closed-source project.
- `Copycat` - Keep up with the latest information and mimic successful models, from the West to China, from China to Africa. Where there's an information cocoon, there's money to be made.
- `Focus on international rather than domestic markets` - Earning in foreign currency, like US dollars, is preferable due to various LLM review issues in domestic markets.
- `Target the wealthy and those who aspire to be wealthy` - These groups are most likely to pay, while others may pose payment challenges.
- `How to promote` - If you're asking this, you probably haven't figured out your target audience, core functionality, key selling points, and where your target audience congregates. Once you understand these, initial promotion won't be a concern.

## Proven Technical Money-Making Schemes
### 1. Wrapper Sites
Whether it's a GPT wrapper site or a Midjourney wrapper site, the basic idea is to create a site and turn it into a SaaS or support private deployment with branding, selling it to small business owners looking to make money. They generate traffic and earn money. These types of sites usually rely on distribution systems.

### 2. API Aggregation
Packaging various LLM or AI capabilities into APIs supports rapid developer integration, saving the hassle of managing foreign transaction accounts and deploying relay servers. This mainly involves earning a margin as a middleman, finding cheap API accounts from dealers, and selling them at a lower price than the official ones. However, it requires ongoing maintenance to keep up with version changes and scheduling controls.

### 3. Card Issuing Sites
Various open-source card issuing sites automatically sell GPT accounts. Many account traders in groups are unaware of these sites. Setting up a card issuing site can be profitable.

### 4. Focused AI Tools
Focus AI capabilities on a specific field or a specific demand of a group, like AI for writing academic papers, AI for automated social media posting, or AI for identity photos. The key in this field is to address a direct need. Sufficient focus brings strength.

### 5. Model Training
Offering model training services is also prevalent, but delivery can be challenging, especially when domestic models might not meet client expectations.
